# Key Logger

## Objective

The Key Logger project aimed to establish a understanding of the CyberSecurity field and Ethical Hacking. The primary objective was to explore how keyloggers operate, how they can be detected, and the potential security implications they pose. By developing a keylogger, I aimed to learn about system vulnerabilities, the importance of securing user input, and the methods used by malicious actors to harvest sensitive information. The project was approached with an ethical mindset, strictly for educational purposes and to enhance my skills in identifying and mitigating cybersecurity threats. Through this experience, I hoped to gain practical knowledge of cybersecurity measures and best practices to contribute positively to the field of information security.
